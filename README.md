1. Logistic Regression:

What it is: A statistical model employed to predict the likelihood of a binary outcome (here, malignant or benign tumor).
How it works: It maps the linear combination of input features to a probability between 0 and 1 using a sigmoid function.

2. Data Preprocessing

Standardization: This is essential for Logistic Regression. It means converting the features to have unit variance and zero mean.
Why it's important: It stops features with bigger scales from overpowering the model and assists the optimization process in converging faster.
How it's done: Utilizing StandardScaler in scikit-learn.
3. Model Training and Evaluation:

Training: The Logistic Regression model is trained on the labeled training data (features and their corresponding diagnosis). The model learns the best coefficients (Î² values) to reduce the discrepancy between predicted and actual results.
Evaluation Metrics:
Confusion Matrix: A table indicating the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Accuracy: The ratio of correctly classified samples.
Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
Recall (Sensitivity): The ratio of true positive predictions to all actual positive samples.
F1-score: The harmonic mean between precision and recall, offering a balance between the two.
ROC AUC Score: Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve Area Under the Curve, quantifying the model's capacity for class separation.
Threshold Optimization: Determining the best probability threshold for sample classification as malignant or benign, usually through maximizing the F1-score.
4. ROC Curve and Decision Boundary

ROC Curve: Graphical representation of the performance of the model across different classification thresholds. It depicts the true positive rate (sensitivity) as a function of the false positive rate (1-specificity).
Decision Boundary: The dividing line or hyperplane between the classes in feature space. It's defined by the coefficients of the model and the selected threshold.
